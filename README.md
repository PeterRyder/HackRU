Reinigen 

The Folder Cleaning Software!

Reinigen (rine-nee-gen), which translates to clean in German, is an application designed to assist you in deleting your folders and files that you don't use very often or that take up too much space. Often times, we let our download folders get out of hand and they become so big that we don't want to try cleaning them out. Reinigen was designed exactly for this purpose; with a friendly user interface, Reinigen walks you through your files and asks you which you would like to delete, and does it for you!

Reinigen works by analyzing the files in a directory you specify with parameters you define, namely, if the file is older than a certain date, and/or greater than a certain file size. It then takes these files, presents them to you, and prompts you about whether or not you would like to delete them, keep them, or have Reinigen ignore them the next time you run it on said directory. If you choose to delete these files, Reinigen then moves them to the recycling bin for you, in case you accidentally need them again, and at the user's request, can create a log file stating what Reinigen deleted. Additionally, Reinigen has the ability to ignore a certain file type that you specify.


Instructions:

1. Download the zip file from github.com
2. Click Reinigen.exe
3. Select the parameters that fit your needs, if you would like one parameter to be ignored, simply set it to 0
4. Add file types to the Ignore list should you want them, if so, separate them by commas like so ".ppt,.docx"
5. When you are satisfied with your selections, click "Choose Folder", and select the directory you would like Reinigen to search in
6. The output window will then show up, do not worry if the window is blank, Reinigen can take a bit of time to search your directories, but rest assured it is still working!
7. Select the files you want to remove and ignore by checking them respectively and click "OK" at the top when you have finished your selection.
8. You will now see that your files that were selected for deletion are in the recycling bin and those that were ignored won't come up on future searches!

This is a Windows only Applicaition for now.
